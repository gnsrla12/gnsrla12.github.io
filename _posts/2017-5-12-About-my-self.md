I am a **M.S. student** in the EE Dept. at KAIST. I am advised by Prof. Changho Suh and a member of Information System Laboratory (ISL). My major interest currently lay in **machine learning and deep learning**.

I double majored Computer Science and Electrical Engineering and received Bachelor of Science from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in february 2017.
