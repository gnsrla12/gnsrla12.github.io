title: About myself
---

I am an **M.S. student** in the [EE Dept.](https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/?language=en) at [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/html/en/). I am advised by [Prof. Changho Suh and a member of Information System Laboratory](http://csuh.kaist.ac.kr/).  My major interest currently lay in **utilizing computer simulation and deep learning to tackle real-world problems**.

I received Bachelor of Science from [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/html/en/) in february 2017 and double majored Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.
