---

I received Master of Science from the [EE Dept.](https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/?language=en) at [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/html/en/) under the supervision of [Prof. Changho Suh and a member of Information System Laboratory](http://csuh.kaist.ac.kr/). I received Bachelor of Science from [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/html/en/) in february 2017 and double majored Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. Currently, I am a Research Scientist at Krafton Inc.
