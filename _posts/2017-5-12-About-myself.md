title: About myself
---

I am a research scientist at [Krafton Inc](https://www.krafton.com/en/index.html) leading the voice systhesis team. I am currently devoted to developing next generation voice AI that can express like humans.

I received Master of Science from the [EE Dept.](https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/?language=en) at [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/html/en/) under the supervision of [Prof. Changho Suh and a member of Information System Laboratory](http://csuh.kaist.ac.kr/). I received Bachelor of Science from [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/html/en/) in february 2017. Previoulsy, I was a research scientist at a Seoul-based medical AI startup, [Lunit](https://www.lunit.io/en).
